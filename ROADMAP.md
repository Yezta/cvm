Implement Node.js plugin (2 hours)
Implement Python plugin (2 hours)
    /// Returns a curated list of well-known Python versions
    /// 
    /// This is a simplified approach for demonstration. A production
    /// implementation would dynamically fetch from python.org or
    /// python-build-standalone GitHub releases.

ruby
Implement Compass plugin (3 hours)
Update CLI to use plugin registry (4 hours)
